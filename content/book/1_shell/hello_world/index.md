When the author opens the terminal, it displays the following text:

```shell
matias@macbook:~$
```

This is called the **bash prompt**. Exactly what the bash prompt says varies slightly, but yours should look quite similar.

After typing `echo Hello world!`, the author's terminal has changed to the following

```shell
matias@macbook:~$ echo Hello world!
```

Notice that the character `$` separates the bash prompt from the text you can actually edit.

When the author now presses `Enter`, the command `echo Hello world!` is run.
This command simply prints `Hello world!`.

```shell
matias@macbook:~$ echo Hello world!
Hello world!
matias@macbook:~$
```
